<h1>C Programming Language Tutorial</h1><br><br>
<p1>
C language Tutorial with programming approach for beginners and professionals, helps you to understand the C language tutorial easily. Our C tutorial explains each topic with programs.<br><br>


The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.<br>

C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.<br><br>

It can be defined by the following ways:<br>


1)Mother language<br>
2) System programming language<br>
3) Procedure-oriented programming language<br>
4) Structured programming language<br>
5)Mid-level programming language<br><br>

 
<h3>1)C as a mother language</h3><br>

C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.<br>

It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.<br><br>

<h3> 2) C as a system programming language</h3><br>
A system programming language is used to create system software. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low-level programming (for example driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc. For example, Linux kernel is written in C.<br>

It can't be used for internet programming like Java, .Net, PHP, etc.<br><br>

<h3>3) C as a procedural language</h3><br>
A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to solve the problem.<br>

A procedural language breaks the program into functions, data structures, etc.<br>

C is a procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used.<br><br>

<h3>4) C as a structured programming language</h3><br>
A structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.<br>

In the C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.<br><br>

<h3>5) C as a mid-level programming language</h3><br>
C is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. C language program is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine independent (a feature of high-level).<br>

A Low-level language is specific to one machine, i.e., machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.<br>

A High-Level language is not specific to one machine, i.e., machine independent. It is easy to understand.<br><br>


<h1>First C Program</h1><br><br>

Before starting the abcd of C language, you need to learn how to write, compile and run the first c program.<br><br>

#include <stdio.h> includes the standard input output library functions. The printf() function is defined in stdio.h .<br><br>

int main() The main() function is the entry point of every program in c language.<br><br>

printf() The printf() function is used to print data on the console.<br><br>

return 0 The return 0 statement, returns execution status to the OS. The 0 value is used for successful execution and 1 for unsuccessful execution.<br><br>
<br><br>To write the first c program, open the C console and write the following code:<br>



#include <stdio.h><br>

int main(){ <br>

printf("Hello C Language"); <br>

return 0;<br>

}
